# PurePad
A simple always-on-top notepad for Windows.

You can easily add, remove, rename pages that are shown as tabs in the notepad. 

The pages can store either plain text, or code using a simple code editor with syntax highlighting. Highlighting in the released version currently supports C/C++, Python, Java and JavaScript. More languages will be added in later releases.

Notes are saved in text files on close, so that it is possible to restore them on launch or access individual notes directly from the Pages folder.

The app is created using wxWidgets. 

Planned updates before v1.0 release:
- More programming language options for code pages
- Rich text support for plain text pages
- Dark color theme
- App icon
- Bug fixes
